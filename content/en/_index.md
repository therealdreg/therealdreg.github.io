Our mission is to make hardware hacking knowledge accessible to people with limited understanding of hardware, electronics, and mathematics

We create tools, documentation, training, and audiovisual materials to help you learn and practice hardware hacking in a safe and legal environment

**Using the same hardware as Bus Pirate v3 but with some enhancements**

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-shield-halved" title="Ruggedized" %}}
Ensuring the safety of three key components: the Buzzpirat device, the target chip, and the PC

We've implemented advanced hardware protections including overvoltage and overcurrent safeguards, reverse polarity protection, and various measures to prevent device damage. 

This includes a PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) for each I/O, Zener diodes, cut-off circuitry, and more, to enhance overall security

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-tower-broadcast" title="Bluetooth and WiFi" %}}
Compatible with Bluetooth/WiFi UART adapters for both iOS and Android, allowing for hardware hacking without the need for a PC

This functionality safeguards your computer by ensuring it remains disconnected from the target chip/board during incidents like short circuits, high voltage connections, or reverse polarity occurrences

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-medal" title="High quality cables" %}}
Providing premium, labeled short cables and SMD IC hook clips, engineered for easy and secure attachment to small chips

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-bolt" title="Power supply for the most common voltages" %}}
Support for working directly with 5v, 3.3v, 2.5v and 1.8v. So you won't need an external circuit to hack a 1.8v chip

Power supply capabilities allow for the connection of more power-hungry devices (~300ma)

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece" title="Bus Pirate v3 compatible" %}}
Fully compatible with both the official Bus Pirate firmware and bootloader, as well as versions supported by the Bus Pirate community

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-leaf" title="We care about the environment" %}}
Designed for easy DIY repairs and modifications: Large components (when possible) and ample spacing between them allow for hassle-free fixes. 

No need for a microscope or expensive tools - a soldering iron and a pair of tweezers are all you need

We strive to use the best environmentally friendly materials whenever possible and cost-effective

In all our work, we use the MIT license, which allows you to use, modify, and distribute our work for any purpose, even commercially
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-toolbox" title="Flashrom, OpenOCD and AVRDude support" %}}
We will ensure it works seamlessly with software like AVRDude, OpenOCD and Flashrom which are widely used, well-known, and stable tools in the hardware hacking scene

We also create new tools and enhance support for existing ones
